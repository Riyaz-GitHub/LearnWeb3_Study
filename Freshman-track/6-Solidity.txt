* What is Solidity?

Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. It is designed to target Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
It is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user defined types among other features.


* Building in Solidity:-

** initializing smart contracts:

//Define the compiler version you would be using
pragma solidity ^08.10;

//Start by creating a contract named HelloWorld
contract helloWorld {

}
