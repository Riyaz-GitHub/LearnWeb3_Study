Remix is an open-source, web and desktop IDE for Ethereum development.
It helps me to write Solidity code directly in the browser and has tools for testing, debugging and deploying my smart contracts to the blockchain.

Link:- https://remix.ethereum.org/

** Navigating Remix:

left-side panel:
1. File Explorer
2. Solidity Compiler
3. Deployer
4. Extensions

Bottom Panel:
There's an output panel, which displays output from your compilation, deployments and function calls.

Middle Panel:
Where I can edit code. It displays the home screen of the IDE, but once we open a file it will become the code editor.


** Remix Workflow:

In the file explorer, we can see options to create a new file or directory, upload local files or import files from Github.

To compile our contracts, we shift over the `solidity compiler` tab.
we choose which `Compiler Version` we want, which smart contract programming language to use and further configuration options.

Note:
Other programming language listed in Remix, `Yul`, is a lower level language.
It is meant for intermediate compilation, and is closer to the hardware than solidity is.
99% of th time you will not be coding in Yul.
Yul docs link - https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/yul.html

clicking compile button will compile the contract and make it ready for deployment.

Moving over to the `Deployment` tab,
There is a `Environment` option and it ships with a `Javascript VM` - which is a simulator of the Ethereum Virtual Machine in the browser.
This allows for fast testing and debugging of your smart contract, as long as your contract doesn't depend on another contract deployed to a real Ethereum network.

To deploy to actual networks, we will want to change our `Environment` to one of the other options listed there.

Remix creates a set of fake accounts, all loaded up with 100 ETH to test with.

Select the contract under the contract dropdown and click `Deploy` to deploy the contract.

Once the contract is deployed, we can see it under the `Deployed Contracts` section. Where i can call functions on my smart contract.
