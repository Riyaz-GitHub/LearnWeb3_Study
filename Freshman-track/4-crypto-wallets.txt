* what is an address?

1. An address is a string of text generated using cryptography to represent your account on the blockchain.
2. I can send and receive funds and can also interact with other applications using my address.
3. An example of an Ethereum address is:
`0x01573Df433484fCBe6325a0c6E051Dc62Ab107D1`


* what are private keys?

A private key is like a password that contains a bunch of letters and numbers that 
allow me to manage the crypto held by my address.

An example of a private key is:
`E9873D79C6D87DC0FB6A5778633389F4453213303DA61F20BD67FC233AA33262`

Address is the username of my account if I consider private key as the password.
That's why its okay if someone knows my address but keep my private key safe.

Caution: Even though a private key acts like my password, only I have access to my private key.
If I lose my private key or share it with someone malicious my crypto cant be recovered.
There is no way to do forgot password, change password or catth the theif in crypto.


* What is a seed phrase?

A seed phrase series of words generated by your cryptocurrency wallet that give me assess to the crypto associated with the wallet.

Think of a wallet as being similar to a password manager for cryto, and the seed phrase as being like the maste password.

An example of seed phrase is :
`dove lumber quote board young robust kit invite plastic regular skull history`


* what is a crypto wallet?

Crypto wallets manage the private keys for my addresses.
They also allow me to send, receive crypto and interact with many blockchain apps.

I can consider my crypto wallet as a password manager then 
seed phrase is the master password for my password manager and 
my multiple addresses and private keys are my username and passwords.
