** What is Ethereum:-

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain that supports smart contracts.
Unlike Bitcoin, which only supports the transfer of the Bitcoin token around the network, Ethereum is more general purpose.

Developers can build dApps or decentralized applications, which can be executed on the Ethereum network.
The global state of Ethereum therefore consists of more than just the balance of every account but also the state of each dApp.

dApps are built on Ethereum using it's programming language, Solidity.
I can write smart contract using solidity and deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum Network.

It maintains consensus across all the computers in it's network with Proof of Work (PoW).In the near future Ethereum will be moving to a Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism.


** Ethereum Basics:-

*** History:

Ethereum was originally proposed by "Vitalik Buterin", a young programmer and co-founder of the Bitcoin Magazine.
When he failed to pursuade Bitcoin core developers that blockchain technology can have wider impact than just monetary exchanges andblockchain need a general purpose
programming languge to go with it.

Then he went ahead and proposed the development of a new blockchain platform with the Turing-complete programming language (Solidity),
that went ahead on to be what we know as "Ethereum".

*** What is Ether:

Ethereum's native curency called "Ether" or "Eth". This token is required to pay transaction fees fro transactions done on the Ethereum network.

*** What are Smart Contracts:

Smart Contracts are small computer programs that are replicated and processed on all the 
computers on the ethereum network without a central coordinator.
Smart Contracts allow you to program contracts that can be automatically enforced by computer code.

The general-purpose nature of Ethereum allows dor any number of possible applications to be built on top of it,
which all inherit the security and decentralization benefits that come from running on the Ethereum blockchain.


*** ERC20 Tokens:

In addition to Ether, people can create and use their own currencies on Ethereum. 
The most common form of currency is ERC20 tokens. ERC20 tokens are smart contracts that fit a specific standard.
Developers can extend beyond the standard, but should meet the minimum requirements when making their own token. 
The standardization allows for digital wallets to easily support all types of tokens, without needing specialized code for each each token created.


*** ERC721 and ERC1155 Tokens:

These are what are also called NFTs. These two standards, similar to ERC20, provide a base line for what requirements should be 
met when creating NFTs.
They provide similar benefits as well, allowing wallets and NFT marketplaces to 
instantly be compatible with all NFT collections as they all follow one of these two standards.
